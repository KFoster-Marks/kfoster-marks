#### How to Create a Gaussian Distribution with Python

> I'm enrolled in Udacity's **AI Programming with Python Nanodegree**, and as part of the OOP module, we were asked to create a class *Gaussian* that calculates and plots normal distribution. While a solution was provided for reference, my solution differed in that instead of "manually" performing calculations, I installed the `statistics` module and used its `mean()` and `stdev()` methods. Work smarter - not harder!
