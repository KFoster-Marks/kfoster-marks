#### Full Text Search with PostgreSQL `pg_trgm` extension

> The `pg_trgm` extension provides functions and index operators that allow for fast text searches.

> The example I created is a Materialized View definition that includes the necessary components to achieve a full-text search.

#### Python `Time` Module's `sleep()` and `strftime()`

> `sleep()` allows you to pause a program's execution. This is pretty cool, and I'm curious to learn about real use cases.

> `strftime()` provides an easy-to-control way of formatting time strings. Pass in formatting specifications as first argument, and the `struct_time` tuple generated through methods like `localtime()` as second.

#### Python's Magic Methods

> Magic methods are special methods (identified by a double underscore prefix and suffix, e.g. `__add__`) whose default behavior can be overridden in order to define special behavior when used with an object on whose Class they are defined.

> The example I coded in order to learn about and practice this concept is not the most authentic, but I did have some fun with it.

#### How to Create a Gaussian Distribution with Python

> I'm enrolled in Udacity's **AI Programming with Python Nanodegree**, and as part of the OOP module, we were asked to create a class *Gaussian* that calculates and plots normal distribution. While a solution was provided for reference, my solution differed in that instead of "manually" performing calculations, I installed the `statistics` module and used its `mean()` and `stdev()` methods. Work smarter - not harder!
